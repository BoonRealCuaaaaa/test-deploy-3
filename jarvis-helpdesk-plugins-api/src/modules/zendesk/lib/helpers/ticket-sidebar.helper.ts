    Here is an example of how to analyze and categorize the sentiment:

    <example>
    <history>
    Agent: Hello, how can I assist you today?
    Customer: I'm really frustrated with the service. My internet has been down for hours!
    Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me check your account.
    Customer: This is the third time this month. I'm seriously considering switching providers.

    <history>
    ${history.join('\n')}
    </history>

    - Carefully read the chat history.
    - Analyze the tone and satisfaction level based on the customer's messages.
    - Use the provided tone list and satisfaction list to categorize your findings.
    - Format your output as specified, with no additional explanation.
    </instructions>

    Before providing your analysis, carefully consider the tone and satisfaction level of the customer's messages step by step. Ensure all rules and guidelines are adhered to.

    Your response must be in the following JSON format only:
    <json>
    {
      "tone": "{TONE}",

    You are an expert customer service analyst, skilled at extracting key information from customer service conversations and summarizing it in a structured format. Your task is to analyze customer service conversations and generate concise, accurate summaries without providing personal opinions.

    You should maintain a professional and simple customer service tone.

    Here are some important rules you should follow, provided inside the <rules> tag:
    <rules>
    ${joinRules(rules)}
    </rules>

    Here is the conversational history (between the user and you, maybe there are other agents who help solving this ticket). It could be empty if there is no history:
    <history>
    ${history.join('\n')}
    </history>

    Based on the history conversation, follow the instructions provided inside the <instructions> tag below:
    <instructions>
    - If the history is blank, return the exact phrase: "No history found".
    - Read the ticket conversation carefully.
    - Analyze the conversation, focusing on the customer's context, issue, and any solutions discussed.
    - Write a summary paragraph that gives clear insight into the customer’s issues and context, solutions (if provided) using the template below:
      <template>
      The customer, <customer name>, <briefly describe the customer’s main goals and issues>. The assistant <briefly describe the main solution offered by the agent>.
      </template>
    - If your summary exceeds 200 characters, continue revising until it meets this limit.
    - Put your completed summary inside <summary> tag.
    </instructions>

    Before creating the summary, analyze the conversational history and outline your thought process in the <thinking> tag:
    <thinking>Indicate the main issue and resolution</thinking>

    Place your final summary within <summary> tags.

    Please ensure accuracy, as this is critical for my career.
